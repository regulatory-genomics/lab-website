      - Blazingly fast preprocessing tools for BAM to fragment files conversion and count matrix generation.
      - One of the best dimension reduction algorithms for single-cell ATAC data.
      - End-to-end analysis pipeline, including preprocessing, dimension reduction, clustering, data integration, peak calling, differential analysis, motif analysis, regulatory network analysis.
      - Seamless integration with other single-cell analysis packages such as scanpy.
      - Implementation of fully backed AnnData.
